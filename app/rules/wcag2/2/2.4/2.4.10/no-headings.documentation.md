# no-headings

## Rule id

`no-headings`

## Definition

This rule determines if the page contains at least one heading (`h1-h6`).

## Purpose

Headings provides information on the structural hierarchy of a document. They help visual users quickly scan and understand web pages for better navigation. Without heading markup, users of assistive technologies are having difficulties to skip through non-interested for them content and navigate the page effectively. Some users will have to wade line-by-line through a web page with missing or improper section headings.

### Non-compliant example

A page without headings.

### Compliant example

A page that contains at least one of the `<h1> - <h6>` heading.
